Info
============================
These plugins only work in a world called "FurPlex" since its our basis to the server!
Please make a world using MV to recreate or import our world!
Commands are stable for plugins like Essentials, Luckyperms and other special server plugins!
- Recommendation is to NOT use MvInventory or any other addons!
- U REQUIRE a lift plugin not developed by us, to make most stuff completely available! Most is Vanilla! (For the world download)
